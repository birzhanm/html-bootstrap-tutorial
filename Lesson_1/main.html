<h2>Question: What is HTML?</h2>
Formally, HTML is a Hypertext Markup Language, a standardized system for tagging text files to achieve font,
colour, graphic, and hyperlink effects on World Wide Web pages.<br>
Informally, HTML is an enriched text file which can be displayed on browser.

<h2>Question 2: How to write a simple HTML file?</h2>
Remember we have said that HTML files are just text files, so it means that they can be written on Notepad.
The only thing to keep in mind is to add an extension '.html'. However, most of IDEs, say Atom, provide
many helpful tools in writing HTML documents such as tags autocompletion, highlighting and so on. So one might
find it easier to write HTML documents using an IDE.

<h2>Question 3: How to work with text in HTML?</h2>
For a plain text, one could just go ahead and write the text. However, for things like headings, special fonts
and so on one should use HTML tags. The tag is something like <strong>this</strong>. Fortunately, there aren't
too many common tags, say around 15. Let us go through some of the tags for working with text:

<h4>Paragraphs</h4>
<p>
  Here I start a new paragraph
</p>
<p>
  Here I start the second paragraph
</p>

<h4>Emphasis</h4>
Is this <em>enough</em> for emphasis?<br>
What about <strong>this?</strong>

<h4>Line breaks</h4>
Line 1<br>
Line 2

<h4>Headings</h4>
<h1>This is h1 heading</h1>
<h2>This is h2 heading</h2>
<h3>This is h3 heading</h3>
<h4>This is h4 heading</h4>
<h5>This is h5 heading</h5>
<h6>This is h6 heading</h6>

</body>
</html>
