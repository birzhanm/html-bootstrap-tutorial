<h2>Question: What is HTML?</h2>

<h2>Question 2: How to write a simple HTML file?</h2>
<p>
Remember we have said that HTML files are just text files, so it means that they can be written on Notepad.
The only thing to keep in mind is to add an extension '.html'. However, most of IDEs, say Atom, provide
many helpful tools in writing HTML documents such as tags autocompletion, highlighting and so on. So one might
find it easier to write HTML documents using an IDE.
